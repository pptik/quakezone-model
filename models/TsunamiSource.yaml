      The value in this column contains the primary earthquake magnitude. Magnitude measures the energy released at the source of the earthquake. Magnitude is determined from measurements on seismographs. For pre-instrumental events, the magnitudes are derived from intensities. There are several different scales for measuring earthquake magnitudes. The primary magnitude is chosen from the available magnitude scales in this order:
      
      - Mw Magnitude
      - Ms Magnitude
      - Mb Magnitude
      - Ml Magnitude
      - Mfa Magnitude

      Abe defined two different tsunami magnitude amplitudes. His first tsunami magnitude (1979) is:
      
      Mt = logH + B
      
      where H is the maximum single crest or trough amplitude of the tsunami waves (in meters) and B a constant. The second definition (1981) is:
      
      Mt = logH + alogR + D
      
      where R is the distance in km from the earthquake epicenter to the tide station along the shortest oceanic path, and a and D are constants.

      When a dollar amount for damage was found in the literature, it was listed in the Damage column in millions of U.S. dollars. The dollar value listed is the value at the time of the event. To convert the damage to current dollar values, please use the [Consumer Price Index Calculator](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/DescribeField.jsp?dataset=101650&search_look=77&field_name=tsevent_vsqp.DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS).

      For those events not offering a monetary evaluation of damage, the following five-level scale was used to classify damage (1990 dollars) and was listed in the Damage Description column. If the **actual dollar amount of damage was listed**, a descriptor was also added for search purposes.
      
      - 0 = NONE
      - 1 = LIMITED (roughly corresponding to less than $1 million)
      - 2 = MODERATE (~$1 to $5 million)
      - 3 = SEVERE (~>$5 to $24 million)
      - 4 = EXTREME (~$25 million or more)
      
      When possible, a rough estimate was made of the dollar amount of damage based upon the description provided, in order to choose the damage category. In many cases, only a single descriptive term was available. These terms were converted to the damage categories based upon the authors apparent use of the term elsewhere. In the absence of other information, LIMITED is considered synonymous with slight, minor, and light, SEVERE as synonymous with major, extensive, and heavy, and EXTREME as synonymous with catastrophic.
